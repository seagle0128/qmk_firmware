- On macOS, `F3` opens Mission Control and `F4` opens Launchpad without needing to configure
  shortcuts in System Preferences
- Toggle N-Key Rollover (NKRO) via `Fn+Y`. On macOS, turning it off is able to address the conflict
  issue between Caps lock and input methods switching.
- RGB lighting turns off when the computer sleeps
- Caps Lock RGB indicator (default: red)
  - the Caps Lock key will light when Caps Lock is enabled with the following options:
    - #define CAPS_LOCK_INDICATOR_COLOR [color] in config.h to set the backlight color used for the
      indicator when Caps Lock is enabled (default: red)
- Dynamic Fn layer RGB indicator
  - When the Fn key is held down, any keys defined on the Fn layer in this firmware or in VIA will
    be highlighted with the following options:
    - #define FN_LAYER_COLOR [color] in config.h to set a static color for defined keys (default: cyan)

RGB must be toggled on for all indicators to function. If you do not want an RGB mode active but
still want the indicators, toggle RGB on and turn the brightness all the way off. The indicators
will remain at full brightness.

NOTE: _USE AT YOUR OWN RISK_
